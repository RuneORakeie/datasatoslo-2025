  Our ambition is to be the leading data and analytics environment in the country. That’s why it’s important for us to be present at professional events like Data Saturday Oslo — to share, learn, and get inspired. That’s why we’re bringing some of our subject-matter experts to the stage, along with engaged participants in the audience and at our booth. We’re looking forward to meeting like-minded data enthusiasts at Data Saturday Oslo in August!
