## From the airport:
Most flights arrive at Oslo Gardermoen airport. We don’t recommend flying into Oslo Torp/Sandefjord as that is a lot further away from Oslo.  
For information about travels to and from Torp/Sandefjord – <a href="https://www.torp.no/en/frontpage/?lang=en_GB" target="_blank">check here</a>
### From Oslo Gardermoen
The airport express train is the easiest and fastest way to get from the airport into the city center. It runs every 20 minutes – 10, 30 and 50 minutes past the hour. It costs 240 NOK per trip. You can find the schedule and information at <a href="https://flytoget.no/reiseinformasjon/praktisk-informasjon/tog-fra-gardermoen-til-oslo/" target="_blank">www.flytoget.no</a>  
However, the regular trains costs only 124 NOK – takes almost exactly the same time into the city. They run from a different platform at 03, 13 and 43 minutes past the hour. You can find the schedule at <a href="www.vy.no" target="_blank">www.vy.no</a>

Tickets for both trains can be purchased near the platforms.

If you arrive – or are planning on leaving – between 00:30 and 04:00, you might have to grab a taxi. If you do want to take a taxi from the airport, we recommend that you go to the Taxi booking machine located outside the terminal building at ground level in the same area as taxi pick up.  
You will be able to book taxis, as well as find an overview of prices. Normally the taxi will arrive within 3 to 5 minutes.

Please make sure to book your ride in advance either through the booking machine or by using the taxi companies' own booking apps. We do not reccomend getting into a taxi without an active booking or making agreements with drivers directly inside or outside the terminal building.
## Hotels
We don’t have a specific hotel we recommend for speakers, but as the venue is only a 10-minute walk from the square in front of the central station – Jernbanetorget – picking a hotel in this area is a safe bet. It is also a pretty safe area of the city and the hotels are quite nice.  
Hotel chains to select from are 
* <a href="https://www.scandichotels.com/" target="_blank">Scandic Hotels</a>
* <a href="www.thonhotels.com" target="_blank">Thon Hotels</a>
* <a href="https://www.strawberryhotels.com/" target="_blank">Strawberry Hotels</a> (former Nordic Choice Hotels)

Some speakers have in the past year stayed at the hotel closest to the venue, <a href="https://anker-hotel.no/" target="_blank">Anker Hotel</a>. According to the feedback we've got it is ok.

Those of us organizers who does not live in Oslo will stay at one of these 3 hotels:
* Scandic Oslo City
* Scandic Byporten
* Clarion Hotel The Hub
