## From the airport:
Most flights arrive at Oslo Gardermoen airport. We don’t recommend flying into Oslo Torp/Sandefjord as that is a lot further away from Oslo.  
For information about travels to and from Torp/Sandefjord – <a href="https://www.torp.no/en/frontpage/?lang=en_GB" target="_blank">check here</a>
### From Oslo Gardermoen
 
#### __Trains__
The airport express train is the easiest and fastest way to get from the airport into the city center. It runs every 20 minutes – 10, 30 and 50 minutes past the hour. It costs 252 NOK per trip. You can find the schedule and information at <a href="https://flytoget.no/reiseinformasjon/praktisk-informasjon/tog-fra-gardermoen-til-oslo/" target="_blank">www.flytoget.no</a>  
However, the regular trains costs only NOK 129 – takes almost exactly the same time into the city. They run from a different platform at 03 and 43 minutes past the hour. You can find the schedule at <a href="www.vy.no" target="_blank">www.vy.no</a>

Tickets for both trains can be purchased near the platforms.

#### __Rideshare__
For rideshare, both Bolt and Uber are available, both for riding from and to the airport and around in Oslo. Uber also have the partnership with some taxi companies in Oslo, meaning you enter your location and destination in the Uber app and select Taxi as the option for ride. We have not tried it ourselves but according to Uber everything else is the same as a regular rideshare experience with Uber. 

#### __Taxi__
If you arrive – or are planning on leaving – between 00:30 and 04:00, you might have to grab a taxi. If you do want to take a taxi from the airport, we recommend that you go to the Taxi booking machine located outside the terminal building at ground level in the same area as taxi pick up.  
You will be able to book taxis, as well as find an overview of prices. Normally the taxi will arrive within 3 to 5 minutes. The taxi companies Oslo Taxi and Norgestaxi have fixed prices to and from the airport (but there are many more taxi companies operating at the airport and in Oslo). 
For Norgestaxi the current price is NOK 799 either way (1-4 passengers). For Oslo Taxi the current price is (for 1-4 passengers) NOK 889 from the airport to the centre of Oslo and NOK 989 from centre of Oslo to the airport.

Please make sure to book your ride in advance either through the booking machine or by using the taxi companies' own booking apps. We do not reccomend getting into a taxi without an active booking or making agreements with drivers directly inside or outside the terminal building.

## Hotels
We don’t have a specific hotel we recommend for speakers, but as the venue is only a 10-minute walk from the square in front of the central station – Jernbanetorget – picking a hotel in this area is a safe bet. It is also a pretty safe area of the city and the hotels are quite nice.  
Hotel chains to select from are 
* <a href="https://www.scandichotels.com/" target="_blank">Scandic Hotels</a>
* <a href="www.thonhotels.com" target="_blank">Thon Hotels</a>
* <a href="https://www.strawberryhotels.com/" target="_blank">Strawberry Hotels</a> (former Nordic Choice Hotels)

Some speakers have in the past year stayed at the hotel closest to the venue, <a href="https://anker-hotel.no/" target="_blank">Anker Hotel</a>. According to the feedback we've got it is ok.

Those of us organizers who does not live in Oslo will stay at one of these hotels. All 3 of them are right next to the Central Station:
* Scandic Oslo City
* Scandic Byporten
* Clarion Hotel The Hub
