Data Saturday Oslo will take place on the August 29th & 30th. Friday 29th will be dedicated for training days and on Saturday we will have our main conference. This will be our 12th time we organize this data community conference ðŸŽ‰.  
In 2024 we had over 300 registered atteendes and hopefully we will beat that this year.

We welcome submissions covering the 3 major public clouds - AWS, Azure and GCP in addition to topics for on-premises and hybrid environments.

## Important dates

* CfS for training days close **February 28th**
* CfS for general sessions close **March 31st** 

## Code of Conduct

DataSaturday Oslo strives for diversity and transparency. You can read our [CoC here](/code-of-conduct).

## Formats

Two types of lengths are available:
* The **general session**, lasting **60 minutes**
* The **traing day**, full day of training from 0900-1700 with 1 hour lunch break

## Selection process

We welcome any and all sessions on data as described above, and we want you as a speaker to know that we will additionally give precedence to the following in our selection process:
* Speakers residing in the Nordic countries 
* First-time speakers. We will offer newcomers an experienced mentor to help them prepare.
* Diversity (i.e. diversity in gender, race and ethnicity, disability and neuro-diversity)
* Diversity in topics and technologies 

## Volunteer-run event

Since this is a event where the ticket fee only covers lunch and the event is run by volunteers in their spare time we are not in a position to reimburse travel expenses for, or pay our speakers.

## In-person submissions only

Please note that this is an in-person event. Remote sessions will not be considered.

## Can I submit a talk with another speaker?

Yes, but 4 maximum (you included). On the CFS website, fill in the e-mail of the other speaker to invite co-speakers.

## Let's submit a talk!

As explained above, the CfS will be open until March 31st 2025. Last year we got over 200 submission, so do not wait till the last minute to <a href="https://sessionize.com/data-saturday-oslo-2025//" target="_blank">submit yours</a>!
