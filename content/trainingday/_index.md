You're a DBA or T-SQL developer, and you have a decent enough knowledge of T-SQL and getting SQL Server, Azure SQL Database or SQL Database in Fabric to do what you want. But some of your code runs slowly, and you run into issues like deadlocks and timeouts. Maybe you've already looked at some execution plans, but you really want to understand them at a deeper level, in order to make your queries run smoother.
  
In our full-day workshop, we'll work hands-on with performance tuning your database, starting with the basics of indexing, understanding execution plans and their operators, and how to rewrite your indexes and queries to get just the right plan. These are patterns and practices I've collected over 25 years of performance tuning SQL Server.

We'll cover

* How a SQL Server query runs
* Pages, heaps, indexes, and the transaction log
* Scans, seeks, lookups, sargability
* Optimizing joins, aggregations
* Window functions
* How to measure and monitor performance
* Useful optimization patterns
* Using columnstore indexes
* Parallelism
* Parameter sniffing
* What hints to use for development, test or production
* Locking, blocking, deadlocks and isolation levels

We won't be looking at hardware or infrastructure - the idea is to set you up for success irrespectively of whatever underlying CPUs, disks, or PaaS tier you're working on.

After this workshop, you'll

* have a good understanding of how SQL Server runs queries
* be able to understand, redesign and leverage indexes
* rewrite your T-SQL code to get the best execution plan

Recommended, but not required: a laptop with a Remote Desktop client, if you want to follow along in the demos.

Join this full-day workshop to learn how to transform raw data into reports that help your audience to work data-driven and take action based on data instead of gut feeling. This hands-on session covers everything from effectively gathering user requirements to translating these into a design (did you know there are 3 layers of report design?). We will show you how to create visuals that lead to actions while telling a compelling story, always prioritizing accessibility and the end user.

This end-to-end workshop emphasizes that report design is far more than just dragging and dropping data onto a reportâ€”it's about creating meaningful, actionable insights that everyone can use.

Key Learnings:

* How to gather and understand user requirements
* Dashboard Design (3 layers of design and UI/UX principles)
* Visualizations that drive action (using DAX)
* Storytelling with data
* Accessible report design
* Developing a way of working to make these changes last
